The movie was underwhelming and, for lack of a better word, dull. They don't take any time to flesh out the worlds or characters or their development and relationships but simply go from point A to B while including as many references from the video games as possible. You're not invested in the characters and their journeys/hardly existent character arches. Maybe those are unfair standards, but there've been so many great kids movies in the last years that it just falls short in comparison."], ["Ikiam P", "Apr 21, 2023", 0.7, "To those of us who left adolescence behind recently or not so recently, it will surely bring us beautiful memories and at times it will extol our scenes behind the video game with a somewhat dreamy air, bringing it to reality, to family life, to day to day of work and life, with its problems and joys. This mixture between the real thing and the 2d video game is a very big and pleasant plus. Then we will move on to a fictional world, which will bring with it, in addition to a good load of memories, a large amount of adventure and action. Here, the story leaves the everyday behind and we find ourselves with adventure and more adventure, with little context, since the context is provided by the video game, it is nice to see how the characters, antagonists and main challenges of Donkey Kong and Mario, little by little are fitting into history; With pleasant surprise we see how some characters are given another meaning, an example of this: 'the princess', who little fulfills her role as a damsel in distress to become a strong and valuable character BUT, preserving all her feminine, sweet and pleasant. The main Bad guy is not so typical either, he's a love-struck bad guy and SOMETIMES kind of cute. The ending also follows the same formula, satisfying, beautiful, with a lot of action, mixing the real world with the video game, yes, all this in a good-natured, calm environment suitable for all audiences, without being childish, however for some reason it is rated PG (with parental guidance) however I think it is more than suitable for all audiences.
